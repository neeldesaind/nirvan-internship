# ChatBot Using Open AI APi

This project implements a simple chatbot that opens in a popup window when the user clicks on the "Chat" button. The chatbot uses predefined keyword buttons and allows users to send and receive messages.

## Features

- **Keyword Buttons**: Predefined buttons that users can click to quickly send common messages like "Hello", "How are you?", and "Goodbye".
- **Message Interaction**: The chatbot responds to user input, and the responses are dynamically updated on the chat window.
- **Responsive Design**: The chatbot interface is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup for structuring the chatbot.
- **CSS**: Styling the chatbot popup window and elements.
- **JavaScript**: Handling user interactions, showing and hiding the chatbot, and sending predefined messages.
