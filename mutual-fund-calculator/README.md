# Investment Calculators

## Description

This project provides two types of investment calculators: 

1. **SIP Calculator** - Calculates the future value of an SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) based on the monthly contribution, rate of return, and investment period.
2. **Lumpsum Calculator** - Calculates the future value of a one-time lumpsum investment based on the investment amount, rate of return, and investment period.

The calculators are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with basic form validation to ensure correct inputs.

## Features
