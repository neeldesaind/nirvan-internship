# Color Change Web Page

This project is a simple interactive web page that allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking on color-coded boxes. It demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionalities.

## Features

- **Color Boxes**: Choose from four colors: Red, Green, Yellow, and Orange.
- **Reset Option**: A reset button to revert the background color to white.
- **Interactive UI**: Colors change instantly upon clicking a box.

## How It Works

2. Clicking a color box changes the background color of the page to match the selected color.
3. Clicking the "reset" box reverts the background color to white.

## Technologies Used
